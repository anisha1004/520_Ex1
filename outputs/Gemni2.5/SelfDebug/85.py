    # Bug 1: TypeError with non-integer elements. The prompt specifies a list
    # of integers, but a robust function should not crash if it encounters
    # other data types (e.g., strings, floats, None). The operation `element % 2`
    # would raise a TypeError. This is corrected by checking if the element
    # is an integer using `isinstance(element, int)`.

    # Bug 2: Inefficient iteration. A naive approach might loop through every
    # index from 0 to len(lst)-1 and use an `if i % 2 != 0` check inside.
    # This performs unnecessary iterations and checks on all even-numbered indices.
    # This is corrected by starting the loop at the first odd index (1) and
    # stepping by 2, ensuring we only ever visit odd indices.

    # Edge Case: Empty or single-element list. While the docstring says the
    # list is non-empty, a production-ready function should handle this.
    # An empty or single-element list has no items at an odd index. The
    # corrected loop `range(1, len(lst), 2)` naturally handles this by simply
    # not executing, correctly resulting in a sum of 0.

    total_sum = 0
    # Iterate starting from index 1 and stepping by 2 to only visit odd indices.
