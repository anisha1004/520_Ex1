    # Bug 1: Non-integer elements in the list. The docstring specifies a list
    # of integers, but a real-world application might pass a list with mixed
    # types (e.g., [5, "a", 7, 1]). An attempt to use the modulo operator (%)
    # on a non-integer would raise a TypeError. This is corrected by checking
    # if the element is an integer using `isinstance(element, int)` before
    # performing the check.

    # Bug 2: Inefficient iteration. A naive implementation might iterate through
    # every index `i` from 0 to `len(lst) - 1` and then check `if i % 2 == 0`.
    # This is inefficient as it performs an unnecessary check for every odd index.
    # The implementation is corrected by using a range with a step of 2
    # (`range(0, len(lst), 2)`), ensuring we only visit even indices from the start.

    # Edge Case: Empty List. While the docstring states the list is non-empty, a
    # robust function should handle this case. If an empty list is passed, the
    # corrected loop `range(0, len([]), 2)` will not execute, and the function
    # will correctly return the initial sum of 0, preventing an IndexError.

    total_sum = 0
    # Iterate by slicing the list to only get elements at even indices [0, 2, 4, ...].
    # This is a concise and Pythonic way to handle the iteration.
    for element in lst[::2]:
        # Check if the element is an integer and is odd.

            total_sum += element
